Package: bitz-server
Architecture: any

Description: ICAP server (RFC 3507) implementation in C++
 bitz-server is an ICAP server implementation in C++. Starting from scratch,
 the server is developed with a modular architecture in mind.
 The server core (written in C++) will handle the client requests,
 manage workers (child processes) etc. and will provide basic handlers
 to serve ICAP requests but won't do any actual content adaptation.
 .
 To extend this core functionality and do some actual content adaptation
 a pluggable modules architecture is used. These modules will provide
 features like content filtering, anti-virus scanning etc.
